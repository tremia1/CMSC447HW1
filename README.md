Project Name: CMSC 447 Homework 1
Project Description:
  -> In this project I created a basic website that includes a home page, about me page, and contact page
  -> Users are encouraged to explore the website by clicking on the navigation tabs of the other webpages provided on each webpage. There is also links for my contact (Github and Jira) on the Contact page.

Note: You would need to have Bootstrap CSS installed and download to view the websites properly!
Instructions:
  -> Download the files home.html, aboutme.html, contact.html, and the background image (20220609_172550.jpg) into the Bootstrap CSS folder (In the Bootstrap folder should have subfolders: css, fonts, and js)
  -> Open one of these files into a webbrowser (I used firefox to test and configure the website). It should work on Firefox, Interexplor and Google Chrome.
  -> Enjoy!
